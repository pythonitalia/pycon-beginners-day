    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. The code in the nested with block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the with block raises an exception, the `__exit__(type,value,traceback)` method is called with the exception details. These are the same three values returned by `sys.exc_info` (Python function). If this method returns a `false` value, the exception is **re-raised**; otherwise, the exception is terminated. The exception should normally be reraised so that it is propagated outside the with statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If the with block does not raise an exception, the `__exit__` method is still called, but its type, value, and traceback arguments are all passed in as `None`."
